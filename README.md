The Youtube-Sets-Downloader is used to download mp3 sets from Youtube.

When downloading the music, it also includes the following information:

## Metadata

- Song title
- Artist
- Album
- Artist album
- Year 
- Genre

## Picture

It also downloads and sets the cover picture for that track.

Furthermore, there is a directiory with scikit-learn library to train and evaluate two neural network models, one for predicting the title of a music file and one for predicting the artist of a music file, using a dataset in a csv file.
